<h1>How Has Saul Bass Influenced The Film Industry, Especially Within The Thriller And Horror Genres?</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>To discuss the ground-breaking and influential work of Saul Bass we need to understand who he is, so to begin, Saul Bass is an American filmmaker and graphic designer who was born in New York in 1920. As a child he drew constantly and as he grew his passion for design continued and he began learning under the guidance of György Kepes who was a master of the Bauhaus aesthetic. He became recognised for his work on the film poster Carmen Jones in 1940 and it was so impressive that the filmmakers asked him to create a title sequence for it too and this was the steppingstone of his career. Basses wanted to add a new level of sophistication to movie posters and to do so he used his minimal style alongside bright and eye-catching colours. Due his movie posters becoming so successful and effective this allowed for his creativity to flow onto title sequences. Sequences had been mostly overlooked by filmmakers, but Bass had other ideas and wanted his title sequences to convey “the essence of a movie and prepared audiences for what they were about to see.” (Britannica, 2019)

  <h3 id="thrillers-and-horrors">Thrillers and Horrors</h3>
<p>As a lover of horror and thrillers I was extremely intrigued when I saw that a lot of Basses work was of psychological thrillers such as Psycho, Vertigo, Bunny Lake is missing and The Shinning. Films such as The Shinning were what sparked my interest in the horror and thriller genre, and it was interesting to research the work of Bass with his simple style of using symbolism, geometric shapes and sometimes a single image to create a focal point on the poster to express a powerful message. His eye-catching work caught the attention of Otto Preminger, a director who was creating ‘The Man with the Golden Arm’ and had Bass create the poster as well as the title sequence of the film. It was extremely well received by audiences, and he went on to create more posters and sequences for Preminger as well as Stanley Kubrick in which he created the iconic Shinning poster and the notorious “Master of Suspense”, Alfred Hitchcock. Bass created memorable as well as effective title sequences for Hitchcock such as Psycho and Vertigo.
</p>

<h6>These cult classic films are iconic due to their effective suspense and with Bass’s title sequences this sets the perfect tone for the film with the effectiveness deriving from his choppy and quick pace editing, it has the audience on edge immediately.</h6>

<p>It was even said that Bass helped direct, arguably one of the most iconic movie scenes of all time, Psycho’s shower scene. The quick pace and jumping from angle-to-angle to create suspense is very similar to Bass’s work. It is easy to imagine that Bass had some input when it came to this scene. In conjunction with this, “Bass changed the common practise in Hollywood, as the effect of good design on a film’s success became apparent” (Eskilson, 2019) Basses use of bright colours and basic shapes to help express complicated and conflicting emotions, for example he was able to convey tones of apprehension through his movie posters such as The Shinning and Bunny Lakes is missing.</p>

<p>He stripped the design right back to simple geometric shapes and in nearly all posters limited himself to three colours: black, white and a colour of his choosing. ‘The Shinning’ poster only consists of two which are yellow and black which symbolises danger and brings back that feeling of apprehension and worry. The ‘Bunny Lakes is missing’ poster only has black, white, and red throughout the whole poster and with the simple imagery of what looks to be an outline of a little girl it invokes an uneasy feeling. It resembles a missing child ad on a newspaper and the worry you feel if you were in that situation and the uneasiness that comes with the thought that something bad has happened to that child.</p>

<h3 id="influence-on-modern-horrors-and-thrillers">Influence on Modern Horrors and Thrillers</h3>
<p>Basses work reaches across all genres from romances such as ‘The Man with the Golden Arm’ to musicals such as ‘West Side Story’ and even to thrillers such as ‘Vertigo’. His minimalistic style helped convey the emotions of the story and</p>

<blockquote>“helped film titles become an integral part of the story and ultimately the whole cinematic experience”<h5>(Jotform,2020)</h5></blockquote>

<p>which was revolutionary as title sequences were seen as boring and unimportant legalities however Bass wanted to change that and was able to create suspenseful and eerie atmospheres with his minimalistic title sequences. Not only did his title sequences express the theme of the movie but his posters did as well with the use of bold colours and unsettling imagery examples of this can be seen within the “The Shinning” poster, and it was Basses belief that “title sequences were responsible for setting the mental and emotional tone for the story that was about to be told.”(Wired,2016) I feel like this is extremely true in title sequences and posters in the horror and thriller genre and with Basses inspiring and revolutionary work it completely changed these two genres.</p>

<h3 id="posters">Posters</h3>
<p>Looking firstly at how Basses work has influenced the horror and thriller genres in terms of posters his minimalistic style with the use of shapes and bright colours are great attention-grabbers. It was said that </p>

<blockquote>“Bass interpreted the nature of film in simple graphic terms, making his posters instantly recognisable and striking”<h5>(Horak, 2014)</h5></blockquote>

<p>and you can see why filmmakers still try to recreate his work to draw in the audience attention like Basses work has done. Basses work is so recognisable with his use of simple geometric shapes and bright colours especially in horror and thriller posters which is ironic as bright colours don’t seem right to use when trying to create a dark and suspense tone for a horror/thriller films. However, using bright colours such as red and yellow invoke the feelings of danger and uneasiness as colours such as these symbolise blood and danger and it is perfect for horror and thrillers. The use of basic shapes as well allow for viewers imagination to run wild as it lets people have their own perception on what they are viewing, and it adds to the idea that things are not always as they seem with hidden imagery. The simplicity of basic shapes also adds a sense of uneasiness to the poster as it shows how less is more and this is very true for horror and thriller films as sometimes an overcomplicated plot can completely ruin a film.
</p>

<p>A great example of Basses influence on horror and thriller posters is the poster showcasing the film ‘Suspiria’, an Italian horror created by the iconic Dario Argento, the poster is extremely simplistic with using of only three colours, white, black, and red, which symbolises danger and death and sets an eerie tone for the film. The only imagery used is a ballerina with blood gushing from her across the poster and the idea of something so gentle and fragile like a ballerina covered in blood is very unsettling but is perfectly executed because of Basses influence.</p>

<h3 id="title-sequences">Title Sequences</h3>
<p>Now if we look at Basses influence over title sequences, we see that his impact has been huge as before title sequences were just annoying legalities but now, they are what sets the tone for the film, and he was able to bring life to them and make them an important part of every film. Basses title sequences have been described as </p>

<blockquote>“hypnotic, kinetic, dynamic assemblages – often teamed with edgy, contemporary scores - that came to define “modern” filmmaking in all its restless energy”<h5>(GQ-Magazine, 2020)</h5></blockquote>

<p>and many filmmakers wanted to incorporate Basses style within their title sequences as it was the perfect way to set the tone for a film especially for horrors and thrillers. Some of Basses most iconic title sequences include Psycho and Vertigo as the use of simple designs from lines to spirals create an almost hypnotic atmosphere and it immediately catches the audience’s attention and helps sets a suspenseful tone for the films. Using the title sequence as a prelude was Basses idea and was the first-time title sequences were seen as an important characteristic of any film and now with every film, the title sequence is created with such importance as filmmakers want to create the perfect atmosphere for their film.</p>

<p>Looking at modern horror and thriller films you can see a lot of time has went into the title sequences and in some of them Basses style is used to create an eerie and suspenseful tone such as ‘A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010)’ where the title sequence is made up with short clips and quick editing to make it seem as though you are flicking through these clips in a fast pace and this choppy editing is often associated with Basses style as the quick pace emphasised the sinister tone that was being created. In this film the quick editing mixed with the dark colours used create that dark and suspenseful tone which is contrasted by the clips of children playing and giggling however, since these clips are slowed and placed in with the choppy editing it creates an extremely sinister tone and that was what the filmmakers were aiming for. It is a perfectly executed title sequence and it was heavily influenced by Saul Basses style.</p>
