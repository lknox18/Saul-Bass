<h1>How has Saul Bass influenced the film industry, especially within the thriller and horror genres?</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>To discuss the ground-breaking and influential work of Saul Bass we need to understand who he is, so to begin, Saul Bass is an American filmmaker and graphic designer who was born in New York in 1920. As a child he drew constantly and as he grew his passion for design continued and he began learning under the guidance of György Kepes who was a master of the Bauhaus aesthetic. He became recognised for his work on the film poster Carmen Jones in 1940 and it was so impressive that the filmmakers asked him to create a title sequence for it too and this was the steppingstone of his career. Basses wanted to add a new level of sophistication to movie posters and to do so he used his minimal style alongside bright and eye-catching colours. Due his movie posters becoming so successful and effective this allowed for his creativity to flow onto title sequences. Sequences had been mostly overlooked by filmmakers, but Bass had other ideas and wanted his title sequences to convey “the essence of a movie and prepared audiences for what they were about to see.” (Britannica, 2019)
